        <h2>Things I learned today</h2>
        <h3>Computer science</h3>
        <p>I did an intro lesson to C++ based off of Dietel
            and Dietel's textbook on C++. My favorite thing I learned was how cin stands for standard input in C++.
        </p>
        <h3>Western Civilizations</h3>
        <p>Today I revised Reading 1 for my civ114 class on the merits of studying history and also how one can value the world. My favorites were: </p>
        <p>1. Aestheticism and how morality and aestheticism are not mutually exclusive</p>
        <p>2. How history is not the past, but a provisional account constructed from evidence we have of what happened in the past. Instead of random facts, sequential events, or a complex mess, what we know of history is constructed of subjective, evidence-based interpretations by historians through the ages.</p>
